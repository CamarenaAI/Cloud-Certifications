# Query relational data in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Azure SQL Database - SELECT

## Creating SELECT statements
There are 6 principal clauses to the SELECT statement:
- **SELECT** -> Wich colums/fields do you want?
- **FROM** -> Wicch table/query do you want it from?
- **WHERE** -> Whats rows do you want? What is the criteria?
- **GROUP BY** not used in Core (SQL) -> When you use an aggregation (such as COUNT, SUM) \
you must have everything else in the GROUP BY. It allows the summarization of those fields
- **HAVING** (not in core (SQL)) -> A "WHERE" clause, but only used after the GROUP BY stage
- **ORDER BY** -> What order do you want the rows

You can remenber the order looking at a British or Spanish keyboard

## Variants of SQL - SELECT statements
Some variants requiere a senmicolon at the end; \
for others (e.g. T-SQL), it is optional

- **_SELECT *_** returns all columns fields

There are variants of SQL wich have slight differences for these 6 clauses:  
String literals in some variants are enclosed with single quotation marks - in others, it is within speech marks

- **_SELECT TOP(10)_** returns the first 10 rows in T-SQL \
but in MySQL you would end the statement with **LIMIT** 10
