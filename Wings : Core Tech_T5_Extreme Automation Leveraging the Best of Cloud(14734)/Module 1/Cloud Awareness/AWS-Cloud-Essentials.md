# 1.1.1- AWS Cloud Essentials
## Introduction
#### What is best way to use AWS?
##### Amazon Web Services has a lot of pieces to it and can be hard to figure out just where to get started. AWS account might be like the Starship Enterprise with many different decks and hundreds of rooms tying together a multitude of AWS services while being commanded by several engineering, science and security teams

#### Course objectives
##### Amazon Web Services has over 100 different services and it just seems like they're adding more and more each year. It's important that you start learning what kinds of services offers, what AWS has named that service, and the architecture icon for that servicethat you'll find in the documentation, blogs and in other courses 
- Summary of the service
- Service name
- Architecture icon

#### What you need to know
- Have basic understanding of how a computer works
- How devices talk to each other in an IP network
- You should have a basic undestanding of how a web server works and how a domain name, like linkedin.com points to an IP address for serving up that site to your web browser
- You should be familiar with what a database does and how you would use it in your application to read and store user data
- If you have any familiarity with a modern programming language you shouldn't have too much trouble reading the code samples
##### This course is going to introduce cloud computing concepts using computer parts that you would find on the shelves of any big box electronics store. Such as CPUs and RAM and networking switches and routers. So it helps if you've used these components before and you're at least a little familiar with what they do. I'll introduce you to some cloud concepts by showing you a few ways you can host a website with AWS such as one build on WordPress
